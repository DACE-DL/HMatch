# HMatch 

HMatch is a hybrid approach which combines statistical methods and link keys for entity matching. Two directions have been investigated:
- Direction 1: Extraction of link keys (axioms for entity matching resulting from Linkex (symbolic approach)) deploying a sampling method for the original datasets that is guided by the links generated by a statistical method.
- Direction 2: Selecting a set of high quality link keys which explains the links given by a statistical method.

# Dataset Description

This repository contains the original DB15PK multi-lingual KGs and the sampled datasets which are derived from them.
The original datasets are four: French (fr), English (en), Chinese (zh) and Japanese (ja).

The sampled datasets, sampledXXX, presented here are sampled from the original KGs using various statistical methods such as BERT, and TransEdge.

# Settings

For DB15PK KGs the alignments whose value of confidence exceeds 0.99 are used for sampling. 

For Memoryalpha-Star Trek Expanded Universe all alignments are considered.

# Running
Direction 1:

- Step 1: Sampling of the datasets using sampling.py passing as arguments path/to/SourceKG path/to/TargetKG path/to/identitylinks path/to/sampledSourceKG  path/to/sampledTargetKG.
- Step 2: Launching Linkex on the sampled KGs https://gitlab.inria.fr/moex/linkex.

Direction 2:

- Step 1: linkex is an alias, in bash you have to write first : alias  linkex='java -mx12G -jar  path/to/LINKEX//LinkkeyDiscovery-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar'.
- Step 2:   linkex  -t in -f testselect -e path/to/identitylinks path/to/sampledSourceKG path/to/sampledTargetKG

# Evaluation
The script EvLinkex.py allows to evaluate the quality of the link keys extracted, passing the arguments path/to/Linkeys path/to/SourceKG path/to/TargetKG
