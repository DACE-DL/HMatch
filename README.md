# HMatch 

HMatch is a hybrid approach which combines statistical and symbolic methods for entity matching. Two directions have been investigated:
- Direction 1: Extraction of link keys (axioms for entity matching resulting from Linkex (symbolic approach)) deploying a sampling method for the original datasets that is guided by the links generated by a statistical method.
- Direction 2: Selecting a set of high quality link keys which describes the links given by a statistical method.

# Dataset Description

This repository contains the original DB15PK multi-lingual datasets and the sampled datasets which are derived from them.
The original datasets are four: French (fr), English (en), Chinese (zh) and Japanese (ja).

The refined datasets, refinedXXX, presented here are sampled from the original datasets using various statistical methods such as LIMES, BERT, and TransE.
